In all three projects, you will design agents that solve intelligence test problems. These problems are broken into four sets of roughly ascending difficulty: set B, set C, set D, and set E. Set B consists of 2x2 problems, while sets C, D, and E consist of 3x3 problems. In some projects, your agents will be able to operate on both verbal and visual representations of these problems. Visual representations are images themselves, while verbal representations are words expressing parameters and relationships. For example, a verbal representation of figure G above might specify that the figure has two shapes, both shapes are filled diamonds, and one diamond is above the other.
The three projects ascend as follows:
● Project 1: Solve Set B (both visual and verbal).
● Project 2: Solve Sets B and C (both visual and verbal).
● Project 3: Solve Sets B, C, D, and E (visual only for D and E).

Generally speaking, verbal representations are easier to work with than visual representations because some human reasoning has already simplified the problem. So, verbal representations are supplied for the first couple projects to scaffold your agent’s reasoning. However, we also provide the visual representations from the beginning so that you can shift to using visual representations as early as you’d like.
Many humans struggle to get all these problems correct. The current state of the art in computer algorithms to solve these problems currently gets roughly 80% of these problems correct. You’re encouraged to try to design the smartest agent you can, but please make sure you’re not holding yourself to the usual standard of “90% or above is an A”. Think about how humans solve these problems, try to design an agent that solves these problems, and use the agent’s performance to reflect on how humans solve these problems. The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between AI and human cognition; the number of problems your agent gets correct is merely a barometer to measure how much you’ve explored that relationship.
